1. It has a list of products;- DONE - available in database file
2. Products can be added to the order; - DONE
3. Products can be modified within the order; - DON
4. Products can be replaced when assembled. - Replacement product operation unknown


## API Endpoints

Here's all the API endpoints with usage examples you need to implement:
https://homework.solutional.ee/api/
* GET /api/products - list of all available products
    curl https://homework.solutional.ee/api/products
* POST /api/orders - create new order
    curl -X POST https://homework.solutional.ee/api/orders
* GET /api/orders/:order_id - get order details
    curl https://homework.solutional.ee/api/orders/:order_id
* PATCH /api/orders/:order_id - update order
    curl -X PATCH --data '{"status": "PAID"}' \
      https://homework.solutional.ee/api/orders/:order_id
* GET /api/orders/:order_id/products - get order products
    curl https://homework.solutional.ee/api/orders/:order_id/products
* POST /api/orders/:order_id/products - add products to order
    curl --data '[123]' -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      https://homework.solutional.ee/api/orders/:order_id/products
* PATCH /api/orders/:order_id/products/:product_id - update product quantity
    ```
    curl -X PATCH --data '{"quantity": 33}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      https://homework.solutional.ee/api/orders/:order_id/products/:product_id
    ```
* PATCH /api/orders/:order_id/products/:product_id - add a replacement product
    ```
    curl -X PATCH --data '{"replaced_with": {"product_id": 123, "quantity": 6}}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      https://homework.solutional.ee/api/orders/:order_id/products/:product_id
    ```

## Goals

1. Implement all API endpoints described above;
2. For `GET /api/products` endpoint keep products list exactly the same as is
   done in the reference API - same products with same attributes (even `id`);
3. Make it possible to configure listening port number of the application without any need to change the code;
4. Before starting actual development, provide us with an estimation of when this task is going to be ready.
